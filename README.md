Date: Aug 19, 2020
Student:  Hussin Alabdrabalnabi
Course: CSE 4820

Description:

This private tutor system will help to find tutors from nearby locations. Tutors can also get a student just by logging onto the website and setting up the profile. In the personal tutor finder system, there are three entities namely, Admin, Parents, and Tutor. Admin can login, manage tutor by adding new teachers and update their profiles. Admin can also manage E-books by adding new books to the library. Admin can also check for the registered parents. Admin will register tutors and credentials will be shared with tutors by Email. Parents can register and login, tutors can be viewed by parents. Parents can filter and select the tutor and after selecting parents will raise the request of the demo lecture.

After attending the lecture, they can book the tutor online, rate the tutor and view the E-Books. The tutor can login by using credentials that will be provided by mail. They can check for the request for a demo lecture and accept the request. They can also check the booking done. They need to set their profile. This private tuition system can help the tutors to get students and parents to find the best tutors for their children.

GIT is a distributed version-control system that tracks changes in source code while developing software. This is meant to organize work between programmers but can be used to trace changes in any collection of files. Its objectives include speed, data integrity and support for non-linear distributed workflows. JSON is a data storage and conveying medium. JSON is often used when the data are sent to a web page from a server. The syntax of JSON is adapted from the vocabulary of JavaScript object notation but the JSON format is text only. In any programming language, code can be written for reading and generating JSON data.

Features

The application will be called online private tutor system. It will be a multiple page web application based on following technologies:

    Java script as functionality handling scripting language.
    JSON as temporary object storing structure.
    HTML as front-end designing.

The main outcome will be a Web Application that will utilize all this technology and will be shared through GIT repository. The application will have the following features:
• A login page to login or sign up.
• A homepage for introduction to features.
• A subject’s web page to show the subjects taught by the teachers.
• The contact web page to show the contact information.
• The about web page to show the mission statement and introduction to website.
• The books tab to show the library of books provided by home tutors.
The idea is to make the application mostly user-friendly so that there will be no overuse of controls, buttons, or graphics in this regard. Minimal CSS can be used to follow the requirements of current web apps but with animations and other things, website may be made fancier if appropriate.
